1)R programming

2)Use the Iris dataset and train a Logistic
Regression model to classify whether a
flower is of species Iris-setosa or not.
Evaluate model accuracy, precision, and
recall.

3)Load the Titanic dataset, perform basic
preprocessing (handle missing values,
encode categorical variables), and train a
Decision Tree classifier to predict the
model. Plot the confusion matrix.

4)Use the Naive Bayes classifier to perform
sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie
reviews, classifying them as either positive
or negative based on the review text.

5)A company wants to predict the salary of
employees based on their years of
experience. The company has collected data
on the salaries and experience of 100
employees. Use simple linear regression to
model the relationship between salary and
experience.

6)Use a dataset with features like square
footage vs. house price. Implement a simple
linear regression model to predict house
prices. Plot the regression line and calculate
MSE and R² score.

7)Load the tissue_gene_expression dataset.
Run a k-means clustering on the data
with K=7. Make a table comparing the
identified clusters to the actual tissue types.
Run the algorithm several times to see how
the answer changes.

8)Using grocery dataset with minimum
support to 0.001 and minimum confidence
of 0.8 build a frequent pattern tree (FP-
Tree). Show for each transaction how the
tree evolves.

9)Use the Apriori algorithm on the grocery
dataset with minimum support to 0.001 and
minimum confidence of 0.8 indicate the top
5 association rules that are generated and
highlight the strong ones, sort them by
confidence.

10)Use the FP-Growth Algorithm to perform
Market Basket Analysis on a retail dataset.
You will extract frequent item sets and
generate association rules to discover
purchasing patterns and help improve sales
strategies.

11)Create Bar Chart-Stacked taking x axis as
Month and Y axis as Revenue and add
Legend
colors &lt;- c(&quot;green&quot;,&quot;orange&quot;,&quot;brown&quot;)
months &lt;-
c(&quot;Mar&quot;,&quot;Apr&quot;,&quot;May&quot;,&quot;Jun&quot;,&quot;Jul&quot;)
regions &lt;- c(&quot;East&quot;,&quot;West&quot;,&quot;North&quot;)

12)Read the file moviesData.csv to create a bar
chart of critics_score for the first 10 movies.
Save the plot.

13)Use the data set “mtcars”and create boxplot
for “mpg” and “cyl” columns
